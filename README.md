# ao3-Quality-of-Life-Additions
A series of additions to site skins to subtly improve your time browsing ao3. 

## What is there in this repository?
1. Code to hide fics made by AI, assuming they've been tagged.
2. Add a little sparkle to your browsing by having LGBTQ tags appear in their relevant flag colours.
3. Make it easier to spot where the character tags end and additional tags begin, either with highlighting or with full separation of tag types. 

## How To Make A Site Skin
This is for those brand new to site skins on ao3, and will show you exactly how to implement everything here for yourself. 

### Creating a New Skin
Under your Profile, there should be a tab labelled "Skins." Navigate there. 
[GIFs to come.]
At the top of the page, click "**Create Site Skin**"
For the title, write something unique. The title is not visible to anyone else, but ao3 requires it be unique. 

### Adding In Customisation
In the large "CSS" text box, paste code from this repository, or any other you are interested in. CSS can **not** be blank to save your skin. 

### But Wait -- I want to use Reversi!
This also goes for **any previous site skin.** The possibilities are endless.
At the bottom of the page, open the "**Advanced**" dropdown, and yet again navigate to the bottom. Select "Add Parent Skin". Type in the name of your previous site skin, likely Reversi, Snow Blue, or Low Vision Default, but again, this works with any previous skin. 

When all this is done, hit Submit!
